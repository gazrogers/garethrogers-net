        <h2>Personal profile</h2>
        <p>
            As a web application developer with over 10 years of commercial experience, I have been involved in the
            design, implementation, and maintenance of many web applications. I am a skilled problem-solver, and am 
            used to working to meet exacting deadlines. While the bulk of my work has been with PHP, I have made use of
            other languages, such as Perl and Scala, to accomplish specific tasks, and I am always willing to learn new
            languages, frameworks, and tools to improve my skillset.
